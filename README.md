# Violence Detection

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process of building a **Violence Detection** system.  
The main goal is to identify violent activities in videos or image sequences using machine learning / deep learning techniques.

## What’s Inside
- Step-by-step data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature extraction from visual data  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Example predictions with visual output

The notebook is structured so you can follow along easily, even if you’re just getting started with computer vision projects.

## Requirements
You’ll need Python and some common ML libraries.  
Here’s a quick install if you don’t already have them:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python tensorflow
You might not need all of these — the exact list depends on your environment.

How to Use
Clone this repository or download the notebook.

Open it in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Run each cell in order, from top to bottom.

Check the outputs and try tweaking parameters for better results.

Dataset
For this example, the dataset isn’t included in the repo.
You can use any violence detection dataset you like — for example, the Hockey Fight dataset or your own collected video clips.

Results
The notebook shows accuracy metrics, training curves, and sample predictions.
You can adjust the model or preprocessing steps to see how performance changes.
